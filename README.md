Exercise: Ensemble methods

Â© ExploreAI Academy

In this train, we'll implement various ensemble methods using the Python scikit-learn library to enhance prediction models.

Learning objectives
By the end of this train, you should be able to:

Identify and apply different ensemble techniques within the scikit-learn framework.
Execute an ensemble method to improve the performance of a predictive model on a given dataset.
Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of ensemble methods versus single model approaches.
Exercise
Exercise 1: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Before we dive into ensemble methods, it's crucial to start with a robust feature selection process. This will help ensure that our models are only trained on variables that have a significant impact on our predictive variable, BiodiversityHealthIndex.

Conduct a thorough EDA to understand the relationships between BiodiversityHealthIndex and other environmental indicators in the dataset. Look for patterns, anomalies, or any insights that can inform your feature selection process.

Steps:

Load and inspect the dataset (URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Explore-AI/Public-Data/master/SDG_15_Life_on_Land_Dataset.csv).
Generate summary statistics for numerical features.
Visualise the distribution of the BiodiversityHealthIndex.
Use a pairplot to visualise the relationships between variables.
